        <h1>Intelligent Email for the Modern Age.</h1>
        <p>The average person has two email accounts, and recieves between 90-100 emails per day.</p>
        <p>That's 65,700 emails per year.</p>
        <p>That number only goes up the more emails you have due to your work, <br/> 
        your websites, entrepreneurial ventures, and not all emails needed to be deleted right away, <br/>
        and not all emails are readily available through the traditional search system</p>
        <p>Tagger removes the need to remember specific keywords by utilizing machine learning to learn about <br/>
        your relationships with your contacts to better sift through your inboxes to find that email, even if you <br/>
        can't remember the email specifics.</p>
